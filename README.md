Emotion Detection From Text 

The state of mind of a person is called his/her emotion. Emotions can be expressed in many ways such as facial expressions, speech, text etc. We chose to work on ‘Emotion Detection from text ‘because, already a good amount of research has been done by the researchers to detect emotions from facial images and audio information, but the emotion detection from the textual data is still a fresh, hot research area and its future is promising. Also, Emotion detection from text involves concepts from ‘Natural Language Processing’. The ability to detect emotion from text can enhance the human-computer interaction. In our project we attempt to detect the overall emotion from a given sentence. We focus on the seven basic emotions i.e. anger, sadness, joy, guilt, fear, shame and disgust which are available in the ISEAR dataset. 
In this project we are using Learning based approach to detect the emotions from text. The classifiers which are used for training the models are Naïve Bayes (Multinomial NB) and SVM (Linear SVC). We compared the accuracies of both the models and we see that SVM has given good results when compared to Naïve Bayes.
